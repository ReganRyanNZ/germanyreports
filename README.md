# Germany Reports

This project is to present news for churches throughout Germany.

### UX for contributors
This project has the following goals:

- Aesthetic presentation
- Responsive UI
- Ease of contribution

The last point is importantâ€”we want as least-techinical people as possible able to contribute to this site. For this my thoughts are as follows:

- One html (slim) page per church
- No extra routing, controller, or navbar modifications should be required, only to add an html file to the views folder

### Design

- Nav hamburger top left expands into flexbox (horizontal for wide screens, vert for mobile), showing category boxes with their sub-categories listed underneath (visible).
- Under articles' main heading will be the date. If more than one article exists, a dropdown will be there next to the date to see archived versions.
- General design is minimalist, simplistic, maximising ease of reading.
- Videos will be hosted on (youtube?), images on (google photos?)
