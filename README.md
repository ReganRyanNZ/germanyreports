# Germany Reports

This project is to present news for churches throughout Germany.

## UX for contributors
This project has the following goals:

- Aesthetic presentation
- Responsive UI
- Ease of contribution

The last point is importantâ€”we want as least-techinical people as possible able to contribute to this site. For this my thoughts are as follows:

- One html (slim) page per church
- No extra routing, controller, or navbar modifications should be required, only to add an html file to the views folder

## Design

- Nav hamburger top left expands into flexbox (horizontal for wide screens, vert for mobile), showing category boxes with their sub-categories listed underneath (visible).
- Under articles' main heading will be the date. If more than one article exists, a dropdown will be there next to the date to see archived versions.
- General design is minimalist, simplistic, maximising ease of reading.
- Videos will be hosted on youtube
  - Click on "embed" to get embed code
  - Under embed code will be a "show more" that lets you disable next video suggestions
  - Actually better to copy embed code from existing video, and replace the unique code
- Images will be hosted on dropbox
  - Get share link, change "dl=0" to "raw=1" and use that as img src.
